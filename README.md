- Run the main.ipynb file to download the directory set up for tasks A and B as well as the datasets.
- Download main_(output).ipynb and open in Google Colab to view the notebook with the function outputs
  and scores that match the data in the report.

  NOTE:
  I wasn't able to push files from a local repository onto the Github repository, so I had to upload the files.
  That's why you won't see a history of multiple updates. If this is essential, I'm willing to link to the
  main.ipynb file on my drive, where you can see the version history. I'll do it upon request only because I
  don't know if it's an issue to breach anonymity by suppling a file that would show a Gmail user.
